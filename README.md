# DOBBY is a game engine built for procedural systems, curves and circular geometry.

Dobby will allow devs to iterate faster for non-Euclidean (circular, curves, spheres) shapes. Procedural animation, physics, music/sfx is another component devs can expect from the engine.

## Example games the engine is built for:
- Gravity Rush
- Outer Wilds
- Mario Galaxy
- Tony Hawk
- Sonic
- No Man's Sky

## Example Features from games the engine is built for:
- Outer Wilds planet local gravity
- Sonic loop run
- Mario Galaxy planet local gravity
- Tony Hawk's ramps
- No Man's Sky level of procedural scale but with an emphasis on depth

## Unique Features
- Local Gravity
- Procedural systems for circular environments
- ASCII editor
- Light weight
- Data driven environment instead of ECS
